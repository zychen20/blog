## About The Blog

The blog is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), deployed on Netlify.
The font I use is [Ubuntu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu). Google Fonts relay service is provided by [Showfom](https://u.sb).

In the blog you can find some technical stuff and some of my thoughts on other topics.

## About Me

I'm Zhenyu Chen, a halfway developer focused on frontend development.

I'm the kind of person who is curious about everything. As a result, my background is a bit mixed.

I used to be a student of business administration major in my undergraduate studies, but later I pursued a master's degree in computer science. Also, surprisingly, I almost went to video production industry in my undergraduate times.

The reason I finally chose frontend development as my ultimate career goal goes a long way. I can say I am a kid growing up with the World Wide Web. I have learnt a lot from the web including English, video production, coding, etc. The web has also shaped my minds, influenced my life, and coded my values. Now it's my time to give back. So I want to connect more people to the web, make the web more accessible, and let more people benefit from the web. Being a frontend engineer seems like the right way to do that.
