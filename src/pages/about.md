## About Me

Hi, I'm Zhenyu Chen, a halfway developer focused on frontend development.

I'm the kind of person who is curious about everything. As a result, my background is a bit mixed.

I used to be a student of business administration in my undergraduate studies, but later I pursued a master's degree in computer science. Also, surprisingly, I almost went to video production industry in my undergraduate times.

The reason I finally chose frontend development as my ultimate career goal goes a long way. I can say I am a kid growing up with the Internet. I have learnt a lot from the open web including English, video production, coding, etc. The web has also shaped my minds, influenced my life, and coded my values. Now it's my time to give back. So I want to connect more people to the open web, make the web more accessible, and let more people benefit from the web. Being a frontend engineer seems like the right way to do that.

## About The Blog

The blog is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), deployed on Netlify.

In the blog you can find some technical stuff and some of my thoughts on other topics.

## About The Language / 关于语言

In terms of the language I choose for my blog posts, it depends on the content. If something is less talked about in Chinese on the Internet, I will use Chinese. The same goes for English.

关于我写作所使用的语言，具体取决于内容。如果我要写的内容，中文互联网上资料不多，我就会用中文写。英文同理。
